# Spark - Carbon Emissions Reduction Project

This project aims to reduce home carbon emissions by optimizing energy consumption based on real-time electricity usage and solar panel generation data forecasts. The system utilizes machine learning to predict emissions and an optimization algorithm to guide discretionary electricity use. A home management interface built with React and AWS allows users to adjust to their energy usage in real-time. 

Conducted a at-home trial for 2 weeks, and observed a 10% reduction in emissions!

The Python script implements a LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network using TensorFlow to forecast electricity usage and solar panel generation. The model predicts future carbon emissions based on previously collected data, allowing the system to make suggestions for methods to optimize energy consumption.
